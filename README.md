# Days of Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction

This is a collection of simple Data Structures and Algorithms that have uses in a lot of different fields. The goal of this project is to help you learn these concepts and to help you practice them. I have implemented in Go, JavaScript and Python. But you can implement them in any language you want.

## How to use this project

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Create a new branch for each day
4. Solve the problem for the day
5. Commit your code
6. Push your code to your forked repository
7. Create a pull request to this repository
8. Repeat steps 3-7 for the next day

## How to contribute

Create a new issue with the title of the day you want to contribute. For example, if you want to contribute to day 1, create an issue with the title `Day 1`. Then, you can create a pull request with the solution for that day.
